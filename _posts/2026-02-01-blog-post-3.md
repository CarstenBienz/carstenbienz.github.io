How the Norwegian word for "stablecoins" was born
======

Norway has a tradition of translating foreign loan words into Norwegian and at NHH's finance department we are often asked to contribute to come up with terms for new financial terms.  In this case my I contributed to this by suggested that stable coins should be called [“tilknyttede eiendeler”](https://www.nhh.no/en/nhh-bulletin/article-archive/2026/january/out-with-stablecoins-bienz-delivers-a-new-norwegian-finance-term/) (a literal translation would be a "linked asset") in Norwegian to reflect the fact that stable coins aim to peg to another asset but that the peg might not be perfect or always work.
