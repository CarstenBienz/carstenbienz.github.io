Wealth Tax and Initial Public Offerings (IPOS)
======
Aksel Mjøs and I argue explain how the wealth tax in Norway makes it difficult to list more firms in [Norway](https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/i/5kMz/formuesskatten-og-boersnoteringer)
 
We argue that the way the tax works makes it unattractice to list firms and that comes at a cost to society in form of reduced risk sharing for owners and prevents the public from investing and sharing in the success of such firms.
