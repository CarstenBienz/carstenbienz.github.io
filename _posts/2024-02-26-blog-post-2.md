PE investments might not make you rich
======
Many believe that the benefits of investing should acrue to the investors and not the fund managers. I [explain](https://www.nhh.no/en/nhh-bulletin/article-archive/2024/february/why-your-pe-investment-wont-make-you-rich/) why that believe may be wrong in markets where fund managers have market power.

In the case of Privaye Equity what matters are the skills of the fund managers. If these skills are relatively rare and when what investors bring to the table, namely funding, is abundant, the balance of power is shifted towards the fund managers and they will walk away with any "excess" returns.
