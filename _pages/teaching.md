I mainly teach Corporate Finance and Private Equity, including VC. At NHH I offer the course [FIE436](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/venture-capital-private-equity-and-ipos/) 

I co-authored a text-book on how to integrate ESG concens into firm valuation with Jose Albuquerque de Sousa, Annie Bersagel, Aksel Mjøs, Marte Siri Storaker, and Isabelle Juillard Thompsen. A free pdf version can be accesed [here](https://doi.org/10.55669/oa0803).

I also teach executives at NHH, both in our Certifief Financial Analytics program [(AFA)](https://www.nhh.no/executive/afa-og-finans/) and in our separate [Corporate Finance Program](https://www.nhh.no/executive/erfaringsbaserte-masterprogram/executive-master-i-anvendt-finans/corporate-finance/)

Finally, I am the proud author of a Harvard Case on [Leveraged Buyouts](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=45561).
