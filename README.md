# About me

I am an Associate Professor of Finance at the Norwegian School of Economcis in Bergen, Norway

My research is focused on how personal and firm's incentives affect financial decisions and how contracts are used to shape these incentives. My work covers Venture Capital, Private Equity, Bonds and Asset Management. 

My teaching is focused on Private Equity, M&A and Corporate Finance in general. I teach both in NHH's master and executive program.
